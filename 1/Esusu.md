The goal for this Proof of Ship:

    Build a new full-stack dApp from scratch using MERN, to deepen my knowledge of backend programming.
    Experiment the use of AI agents on the full-stack dApp
    Document journey on Farcaster
    Consider adding them as features into Esusu
    Test out ideas for the Agentathon hackathon
    Also consider Ethglobal AI Agent hackathon and Safe Agentathon => Implemented DCA and streaming of funds via agents

What are you planning to achieve? Be as detailed as possible. Try to break it down into weekly milestones.

## Problem Esusu is Solving

    The growing trend of poor savings habits
    Also fragmentation of web3 banking services
    Increasing bad debts/poor debt repayment rate

    
## Solution Esusu is Bringing

    Pool community savings dashboard
    Individual Savings infrastructure
    Utility bills payment 
    AI enhanced blockchain services

## Framework Used for Building Esusu

    Celo Composer
    NextJS
    Foundry
    MongoDB
    Goat SDK    

## General Feedback

    While building a DCA-implementing agent, I realised Celo wasnt fully supported
    Also, Polymarket isn't supported at all by Celo
    Deploying a fullstack fronend for an agent is quite problematic especially with older versions of celo_composer on which Esusu is currently on.
