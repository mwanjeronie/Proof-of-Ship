## Short Description

The goal is to develop and integrate a Donation Handler Smart Contract into Giveth’s donation flow on Celo. This contract will serve as an intermediary between donors and project wallets, enabling on-chain tracking, automation, and improved reporting.

## Monthly Goal for this Proof of Ship

- Research on similar smart contracts and necessary imports/libraries 
- Wrote smart contract documentation and project milestones 
- Peer review of contract stack and security considerations 
- Submitted project to Proof of Ship repo
- Finalized architecture 
- Wrote first draft of solidity smart contract 
- Deployed first draft contract to Celo Alfajores
- Started work on foundry tests

## Problem

Giveth’s backend is 5 years old, making it outdated and inefficient.

* Relies on centralized back-end service to track donation data and maintain state
* Donations appear as regular token transfers, making them hard to track
* Not suited for external teams to make donations or query donation data 
* RPC or other infra outages cause massive headaches and lost donations

A Donation Handler Smart Contract modernizes this flow, making it flexible, low overhead, transparent, and scalable.

## Solution

The Donation Handler Smart Contract solves these issues by:
* Allowing donations to be clearly tracked and indexed on-chain
* Reducing reliance on centralized back-end service
* Enabling AI-based donations, opening up design space for new funding mechanism experimentation
* Allowing external transactions, so donations can be made outside Giveth’s UI.
* Increasing reliability of donation verification, lowering risks of missing donation data
* Increasing transparency of donation activity by making it distinguishable on-chain

## Architecture

*Components:**
1. DonationHandler.sol
    * Accepts donations.
    * Routes funds to project wallets.
    * Supports donation bundling & batch donations.
    * Stores transaction metadata for verification.
2. Backend Services
    * Subsquid indexer for tracking smart contract interactions
    * mapping indexer queries for getting on-chain information
    * Integrating with existing postgres, nodejs & redis services for verifying donations and filling assets prices
    * GraphQL endpoints for FE
3. Front-End Integration
    * User based smart contract interactions on donation flow
    * Bundling operations for multiple transactions
