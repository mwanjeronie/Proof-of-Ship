# Key Challenges in DeFi

1. **Complex Interactions** – Users face difficulties navigating technical interfaces and executing multi-step transactions.

2. **High Entry Barriers** – Many users lack the necessary knowledge or tools to engage with decentralized finance.

3. **Limited Accessibility** – DeFi platforms remain difficult to access for non-technical users.

4. **Fragmented Experience** – Managing multiple dApps and wallets adds complexity to transactions.

2. **Integrated DEX and Staking** – Enable users to trade tokens and stake assets directly within the chat, removing the need for external dApps.

3. **Automated DeFi Actions** – Leverage an AI-powered assistant to handle complex DeFi tasks, minimizing user effort.

4. **Seamless Wallet Connection** – Allow users to connect their wallets instantly and perform transactions without switching apps or dealing with complex interfaces.

5. **User-Friendly Interface** – Simplify interactions by enabling financial operations through natural language, removing the need for prior DeFi knowledge.
