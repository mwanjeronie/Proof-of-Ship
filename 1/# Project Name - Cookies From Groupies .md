## Problem

- Accelerate visiblity increase popularity and fame for local artists that are underdogs and not very well to do but has amzing talent.

**Cookies From Groupies** aims to revolutionize how local independent artists sustain their creativity by offering them decentralized tools for financial growth and fan engagement.


## Solution

Cookies From Groupies is a decentralized application (dApp) that bridges the gap between artists and their audiences. It allows artists to build their online profiles, showcase their work, and receive support in creative ways. Fans can explore artist profiles, support them through donations, purchase NFTs, and even stake tokens to share in the yields generated. Supporters unlock exclusive content and gain access to token-gated chats with the artists they support.

## Contracts on Celo
- Unable to Deploy due to chain halt from last few days. 

- Link to Contract Address on Celo or Celo Alfajores Testnet (celoscan)	
- Contracts need to be **verified**
- Please use a smart contract framework like hardhat or Foundry in your project. For building continuously, a deployment script should be used. This is crucial for more complex smart contracts and testing. This will be added to your technical score.
- Adding **tests** to your project should be a **standard** and is not complicated to write using AI. 
- **NOTE**: Our AI Agent Judge tracks transactions on deployed contracts. Contracts are required in order to receive monthly rewards.
