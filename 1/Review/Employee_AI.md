# Employee.ai Codebase Report

## Overview:

Employee.ai aims to be an AI-powered platform with virtual agents for various tasks. The codebase includes a frontend (Next.js), an agent stack (CDP AgentKit), and a backend API (Nest.js).

## Implemented Features:

- **Frontend User Interface:** A Next.js-based user interface exists, allowing users to interact with AI agents through a chat-like interface.
- **User Authentication:** Implemented using Privy Auth. Users can log in.
- **Server Wallets:** Basic wallet creation and management are present, integrated with Privy Server Wallets. The front-end wallet component uses Wagmi.
- **Chat Interface:** Exists. Messages can be sent and received.
- **Theme Toggling:** Light and dark theme support.

## Missing/Partially Implemented Features:

- **Onchain Agent:** The codebase has logic for sending messages to a "WALLET" agent, which is supposed to carry out onchain actions, suggesting the intention to implement onchain agent capabilities. However, from the code provided, it's not apparent if all the onchain actions (buying tokens, creating NFTs, launching contracts) mentioned in the README are fully implemented. Needs further investigation.
- **Twitter Manager:** While `twitterActionProvider` exists in the codebase, the functionality is incomplete. It lacks the ability to perform all actions related to Twitter management.
- **Agent Support:** There are multiple agents mentioned in `employeeData.ts` however there is no switch between different types of agent to handle messages in the front end.
- **Server wallet functionality:** The provided code appears to stub Privy calls to create the wallets, however, no signing functionality or management is fully implemented.

## Potential Issues & Bugs:

- **Hardcoded Values:** Some components contain hardcoded values, such as contract addresses, which limit flexibility and reusability.
- **Error Handling:** Basic error handling is present, but might not be comprehensive. Some functions simply return generic error messages.
- **Incomplete Features:** Some features (e.g., Twitter integration) are not fully implemented and might require additional work.
- **Privy Stub:** There is not any actual server-side privy implementation as can be seen in `server/src/modules/wallet/service/privy.service.ts`. It's just a stub that is left incomplete.

## Legitimacy:

The codebase shows a clear effort to implement the features described in the README, however, the lack of full implementation and the presence of stubs make it an incomplete application.
