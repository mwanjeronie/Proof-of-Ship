# Codebase Report

This report summarizes the implemented and missing features of the provided codebase, based on the README and the code itself. The codebase appears to be a Next.js application for a "3 Wheeler Bike Club," focusing on membership, ownership, and sponsorship, with connections to blockchain technology via attestations.

## Implemented Features

- **Next.js Setup:** The codebase is indeed a Next.js project, with a standard folder structure (`app/`, `components/`, `public/`).
- **Page Routing:** The `app/` directory implements page routing with `page.tsx` files for key sections like dashboard, membership, ownership, profile, and sponsorship.
- **UI Components:** The `components/ui/` directory provides a rich set of reusable UI components (buttons, cards, alerts, inputs, etc.) using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
- **Landing Page:** The `app/page.tsx` file serves a landing page implemented using `components/landing/*`.
- **Authentication:** The project integrates with Privy for authentication (`providers/PrivyContext.tsx`, and use of `@privy-io/react-auth`). Login and logout functionalities are present. Also include `SmartWalletsProvider`.
- **Membership Dues:** Membership payments and the viewing of receipts are implemented. Paystack is integrated for payments.
- **Attestations:** Core attestation functionalities are implemented. Actions for getting and posting different types of member attestations exist. There are utils for deconstructing, decoding, and calculating credit scores, and more.
- **Sidebar Menu:** The sidebar menu is implemented.
- **Wagmi Implementation:** Wagmi to the project is implemented using `WagmiContext.tsx`, and `config.ts`.

## Potential Issues and Missing Features

- **Incomplete Functionality:** The sponsorship and ownership pages display a construction image, suggesting these features are not fully implemented. There is logic for applying for ownership in `ownership/authorized.tsx`, but it looks incomplete.
- **Error Handling:** In some actions files, the error handling only includes `console.log(error)`, which is insufficient for production. Proper error propagation and user feedback mechanisms are needed.
- **Data Fetching:** The data that is being fetched from the backend to display in the web app might have issues. Some data is not being fully used or showed.
- **No API routes:** All the actions call the backend. There are no API routes to handle the request.

## Overall

The codebase demonstrates a legitimate effort to build a functional application. The core features of Next.js setup, UI components, authentication, and membership dues are implemented. However, the "sponsorship" and "ownership" functionalities seem incomplete, and error handling needs improvement.
