## Tranzit Codebase Report

This report assesses the implementation status of features described in the Tranzit README, based on the provided codebase.

### Implemented Features:

- **Blockchain (Celo)**: The codebase includes configurations for connecting to Celo's Alfajores testnet and mainnet (hardhat.config.ts), indicating Celo integration.
- **Smart Contracts**: There are contract deployment scripts (deploy.ts, taxiPayment.ts), contract ABI files, and a TaxiPaymentcUSD contract exists.
- **QR Code Payments**: The react-app folder contains components like QRCodeDisplay.tsx, ProcessPayment.tsx, and ReceivePayment.tsx, suggesting QR code functionality is implemented.
- **Wallet Compatibility**: The ConnectButton.tsx component and Wagmi integration show support for wallet connections.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: A service worker file (service-worker.js) and PWA-related components (PwaInstallPrompt.tsx, iOSinstall.tsx) suggest PWA functionality.
- **GraphQL Integration**: Apollo Client setup (apolloClient.ts) and GraphQL queries (getPaymentData.ts) show integration with The Graph for data fetching.
- **Driver and Commuter Interfaces**: Separate pages (driver/index.tsx, commuter/index.tsx) indicate distinct interfaces for drivers and commuters.

### Partially Implemented/Potentially Buggy Features:

- **Incentive System**: The IncentiveHistory.tsx component and GraphQL queries for incentives (getPaymentData.ts) exist, also the smart contract has functions to provide the functionality. But incentive logic in smart contract is incomplete.
- **Fonbnk API Integration**: The code integrates Fonbnk as a widget using an IFrame, but seems incomplete. The Fonbnk secret key is not being passed correctly. FonbnkWidget.tsx needs more work.

### Missing Features:

- **Gasless Transactions (Meta-transactions)**: No implementation found in the codebase.
- **Privy Authentication**: There are no components or hooks for Privy integration.
- **Multilingual Support**: No evidence of multilingual support in the codebase.
- **Khule (AI Assistant)**: The InfoHub is a basic FAQ, not a sophisticated AI assistant for onboarding.
- **Better progress reporting on transaction loading time**: Not implemented

### Overall Assessment:

The codebase demonstrates a functional application with blockchain integration, payment processing via QR codes, and user interface components for drivers and commuters. However, the codebase doesn't fully implement all features described in the README.
