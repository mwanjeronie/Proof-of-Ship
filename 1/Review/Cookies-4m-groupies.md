## Codebase Breakdown: Cookies From Groupies

### Implemented Features:

- **Artist Profile Creation:** The codebase has components and pages (`src/pages/ArtistListing.tsx`, `src/components/ArtistModal`) dedicated to artist profiles. Artists can apparently list their artworks, bio, and social links.
- **Browse Artists:** The gallery page (`src/pages/Gallery.tsx`) is present, suggesting a way to browse artists. The landing page also uses a `FloatingFrames.tsx` component to display artworks of different artists.
- **Supporter Activity Tracking:** The "Groupies" page (`src/pages/Groupies.tsx`) aims to show user activities like stakes, purchases, and donations, displaying data (or a "no activity" message) based on wallet connection.
- **Wallet Connection:** There are hooks (`src/hooks/useWallet.tsx`) and components (`src/components/WalletModal.tsx`) that handle connecting to different wallets (MetaMask, Coinbase, etc.) using injected provider via `Window.ethereum`.
- **Theme Provider:** The application provides light and dark themes, this feature is implemented using `ThemeProvider.tsx`.

### Potentially Missing/Incomplete Features & Potential Issues:

- **Monetization Options (NFTs, Yields):** The README mentions NFT minting/selling and yield generation from staking. There's an `NFTFactory` contract deployment, but it is unclear if and how this translates to a functional NFT marketplace with art.
- **Token-Gated Content and Chats:** There is no code showing that exclusive content is unlocked. There's also no indication of token-gated chats.
- **Blockchains Integration:** The README mentions multiple blockchains, but the script `scripts/deploy.ts` deploys the code only to Celo.
- **Donations:** There is no donation button/integration shown in the code.
- **Notifications:** While the README mentions Push Protocol, no actual Push Protocol integration was found.
- **Data Handling:** The application uses Supabase for data storage.

### Overall Legitimacy:

The codebase seems to be a work in progress. Key features, while conceptually present, may not be fully implemented or functional. There are smart contracts, but the dApp's features are not implemented correctly with them. The front end seems to be working correctly and is connecting to a back end, but several of the connections to web3 are not fully implemented.
