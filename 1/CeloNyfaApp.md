## Problem
A fundamental issue in crypto investing is that many investors skip doing their own research (DYOR) due to:
- Time constraints in analyzing multiple research platforms
- Complexity of aggregating data from various sources (Messari, Arkham, CoinGecko, etc.)
- Overwhelming amount of information to process
- Lack of easy-to-digest format for quick decision making

While platforms like Messari and Arkham provide excellent data, users often:
- Don't have time to visit multiple platforms
- Get overwhelmed by complex dashboards
- End up making investment decisions without proper research
- Miss critical information spread across different sources

## Solution & Vision
Nyfa captures a moment in a cryptocurrency's lifetime, similar to what [carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/) does for code snippets. Users can generate and download shareable PNGs containing crypto asset reports, which can then be minted as NFTs.

Nyfa solves the research challenge by:
- Aggregating essential data from multiple trusted sources into one view
- Presenting information in an easy-to-digest visual format
- Making research shareable and verifiable through NFTs
- Reducing the time needed for basic but comprehensive research
- Lowering the barrier to conducting proper DYOR

### Technology Stack
- Frontend: Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- Authentication: Supabase Auth
- Database: Supabase Postgres
- Blockchain: Celo Network
- Storage: IPFS (Pinata)
- Web3: RainbowKit, ethers.js
- APIs: CoinGecko, CryptoNewsAPI
- Monitoring: Sentry
- Analytics: Mixpanel

### Frontend Flow
1. User Authentication
   ```
   Creator creates an account
   ↓
   They are authenticated using Supabase Anon Auth
   ↓
   They can create a NoFA which is saved to Supabase Postgres Database
   ```

2. NoFA Creation Process
   ```
   Creator selects a coin
   ↓
   The coin id is used to call CoinGecko API for data
   ↓
   The coin id is also used to call CryptoNewsAPI for news headlines and sentiment
   ↓
   The NoFA is created using the fetched data
   ↓
   A user can see that information
   ```

### Smart Contract Flow
```
Creator saves the PNG to Pinata
↓
Pinata returns an IPFS link 
↓
Creator creates NFT, which uses the IPFS link as metadata to the PNG
```

### Implementation Challenges
1. Image Generation
   - Challenge: HTML2Canvas library doesn't render iframes in PNG generation
   - Solution: Exploring alternatives to replace iframe-based content display for better PNG output

2. Data Provider Limitations
   - Challenge: CryptoNewsAPI's trial period (4 days) and high pricing limiting news integration
   - Solution: Investigating alternative news providers like CryptoPanic for more sustainable integration

3. Web3 Integration
   - Challenge: Initial issues with Coinbase's OnchainKit
   - Solution: Migrated to RainbowKit for improved reliability and user experience
