## Problem

Overcharging
South African taxis often overcharge passengers, taking advantage of their lack of knowledge of the local area. Taxify is addressing this issue by providing transparent pricing and ensuring passengers are not overcharged for their rides.

## Solution

Taxify implements blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and accountability. This will help to increase trust between drivers and passengers.
