Set up the core project architecture for both front-end and back-end.
Establish basic scaffolding for PWA elements.

Week 2 – PWA Implementation

Implement key PWA features:  responsive layouts,
Ensure cross-platform and cross-browser compatibility.
Conduct initial testing on different devices.

Week 3 – Web3 Integration (for Web2 Access)

Integrate a Web3 wallet provider (e.g., MetaMask or WalletConnect).
Set up secure interaction flows between the PWA and the blockchain.
Begin testin (transactions, contract reads) from a typical Web2 browser interface.

Week 4 – Easy Onboarding

Implement simple flows that guide users through wallet creation or linking.
Polish the UX/UI to reduce friction for first-time users.
Test user flows, gather feedback, and refine the onboarding process.

## Problem

Overcharging
South African taxis often overcharge passengers, taking advantage of their lack of knowledge of the local area. Taxify is addressing this issue by providing transparent pricing and ensuring passengers are not overcharged for their rides.

## Solution

Taxify implements blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and accountability. This will help to increase trust between drivers and passengers.

## Architecture

## Deployed Contract Addresses on Celo

- Contracts should be verified
