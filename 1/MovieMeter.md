## Monthly Goal for this Proof of Ship	

This month, i aim to build and deploy the MovieMeter DApp, allowing users to vote "Yes" or "No" on movies they like.

Weekly Milestones:
- Week 1: Finalize smart contract for voting and deploy on Celo Alfajores testnet using thirdweb.
- Week 2: Develop frontend using React & Thirdweb SDK to interact with the contract.
- Week 3: Integrate wallet connection and voting UI.
- Week 4: Testing, debugging, and deploying the DApp on vercel. 	

### Detailed description of the work you did this month during the contest	

Feature 1: Deployed a working Smart contract for voting on thirdweb → (https://github.com/GideonNut/Moviemeter/tree/smartcontract)] - 0x7d9cbfc9290ca41b4b08ac9593575dd4dd5e9809 ca 1

Feature 2: Frontend development with Thirdweb and Wallet connection (Users are able to see movies to vote only when they connect their wallets or sign in)  → (https://github.com/GideonNut/Moviemeter/tree/frontend)]



## Problem	

- What problem does your project solve? 

Users often struggle to find consensus on movie ratings. Traditional rating platforms don’t offer simple Yes/No voting, which can be more engaging and fun for casual viewers.

Additionally, i have a growing community on Telegram with over 50,000 subscibers (T.me/movies_society) where members actively discuss and rate movies. However, the community lacks a structured and transparent way to aggregate votes, making it difficult to track collective opinions effectively.

## Solution	

- How does your project solve that problem?	
- What are your competitors? Why are you solving this better? Could you use their product to build something on top?

**MovieMeter** provides a blockchain-based, transparent voting system, allowing users to vote on movies in a decentralized way.

Why is this better?

No centralized manipulation of votes.
Transparent & immutable results.
Simple and engaging UI.
Seamless integration with our Telegram community, allowing members to cast votes that are permanently recorded on the blockchain.

Competitors: IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Letterboxd.

Why is this better? MovieMeter focuses on real-time, simple Yes/No voting, backed by blockchain security and community engagement.

## Architecture	

- What is your tech stack? Please list all Web3 libraries and protocols you are planning to use. 
- High level overview of your project architecture	

Tech Stack:

Smart Contract: Thirdweb, Solidity, Hardhat, Celo
Frontend: React, Thirdweb SDK, TailwindCSS
Backend (if needed): Firebase / Supabase
Wallet: Celo Wallet, MetaMask
Blockchain: Celo Alfajores testnet

High-Level Architecture:

User connects their wallet.
Then is able to select a movie and vote “Yes” or “No.”
Votes are stored on Celo blockchain for transparency.
Users can see real-time results.

## Deployed Contract Addresses on Celo	

- Contract Address on Celo or Celo Alfajores Testnet.	
- NOTE: Our AI Agent Judge tracks transactions on deployed contracts. Contracts are required in order to receive monthly rewards.
