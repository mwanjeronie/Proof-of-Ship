## Problem
Web3 businesses lose 85% of potential customers who want to pay with cards but can’t navigate crypto wallets, KYC hurdles, or volatile settlements.

**For Users**: Painful on-ramps, KYC delays, waiting for crypto deposits, and multi-step transfers.

**For Web3 Businesses**: Difficulty accepting payments from web2 users due to crypto complexities.

## Solution
[Normie.tech](https://normie.tech/) accept card payments from your customers and auto-convert them to instant stablecoin settlements for you, no crypto complexity for your customers.

### Why It Matters:
**For Web3 Businesses**: Tap into 4B+ card users, slash payment friction, and grow revenue 20-30% faster.

**For Web2Users**: Pay with cards they already trust. 

**No Wallets + No KYC = No Worries**

🚀 Turn payment barriers into growth engines.
