## Goal for This Proof of Ship

The goal is to develop a decentralized event management platform on the Celo blockchain. The dApp will allow users to:

- Create an event.
- View a list of events created by themselves and others.
- Join an event.
- View detailed event information.
- Delete an event (only if they are the owner).
- Purchase tickets using Mento stablecoins (cUSD, cEUR, cCOP)

### Weekly Milestones

**Week 1:**

- Set up the smart contract for event creation, listing, and deletion.
- Implement event ownership validation for deletion.
- Deploy the initial smart contract on the Celo testnet.

**Week 2:**

- Develop the front end with React.js and integrate the smart contract.
- Implement event listing and detailed views.
- Allow users to join events.

**Week 3:**

- Implement purchase tickets using Mento stablecoins (cUSD, cEUR, cCOP)
- Finalize UI/UX improvements.
- Test smart contract interactions thoroughly.
- Deploy the dApp and verify contracts on Celo.

**Week 4:**

- Bug fixes and optimizations.
- Prepare documentation and finalize submission.

## **Detailed Description of the Work Done During the Contest**

During the contest, I developed and deployed a decentralized event management platform on the **Celo blockchain**, enabling users to create, manage, and attend events securely. The platform leverages **smart contracts for transparency, ownership validation, and trustless transactions**.

### **Key Features Implemented:**

- **Smart Contract Development:** Created and deployed Solidity smart contracts for event creation, ticketing, and ownership validation.
- **Frontend Integration:** Built a responsive **Next.js** frontend that interacts seamlessly with the blockchain.
- **Event Management:** Users can **create, list, and delete events**, ensuring full control over event data.
- **Ticket Purchase with cUSD:** Integrated a secure payment system using **Celo's stablecoin (cUSD)** for ticket transactions.
- **Ownership Validation:** Implemented access control to **prevent unauthorized event deletion** and ensure only event creators can modify their events.
- **Smart Contract Testing & Deployment:** Conducted unit tests on smart contracts and deployed them on **Celo Alfajores Testnet** for real-world testing.

---

## **Problem**

Traditional event management platforms like **Eventbrite** and **Meetup** are **centralized**, meaning event organizers and attendees rely on third-party services to create, manage, and purchase tickets. This model introduces:

- **Lack of transparency:** Users must trust platforms with event data and payments.
- **High fees:** Third-party services charge processing fees for ticket sales.
- **Data Ownership Issues:** Event creators do not have full control over their event details and attendee lists.

---

## **Solution**

A **decentralized event management platform** that allows users to create, join, and manage events while maintaining full ownership. Key benefits of our approach:

- **Transparency:** All event and ticketing data is stored on-chain, ensuring verifiability.
- **Trustless Transactions:** Users purchase tickets via smart contracts using **cUSD**, eliminating the need for intermediaries.
- **Decentralized Ownership:** Event creators have full control over their events, preventing censorship or data manipulation.

Our platform leverages **blockchain technology to eliminate middlemen**, providing a more transparent, secure, and user-controlled event management experience.

## **Architecture**

### **Technology Stack:**

- **Frontend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React framework)
- **Blockchain:** [Celo](https://celo.org/) smart contracts written in Solidity
- **Smart Contract Interaction:** [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/)
- **Payment Processing:** Celo's stablecoin (cUSD)
- **Wallet Integration:** [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for authentication and transactions
- **Storage:** On-chain event data (no centralized database)
- **Package Manager:** [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for dependency management

### **High-Level System Flow:**

1. **Event Creation:** Users submit event details, which are stored on-chain via a Solidity smart contract.
2. **Event Listing:** The frontend fetches and displays active events from the blockchain.
3. **Ticket Purchase:** Attendees buy tickets using **cUSD** via the smart contract.
4. **Ownership Validation:** Only event creators can modify or delete their events.
5. **Smart Contract Execution:** The blockchain processes event-related transactions transparently.

---

## **Challenges & Solutions**

### **1. Smart Contract Event Deletion Not Updating Frontend**

**Issue:** When an event was deleted, the frontend didn't update automatically.  
**Solution:** Implemented state updates after transactions and refetched event data upon deletion.

### **2. Handling Blockchain Transactions in UI**

**Issue:** Users needed better feedback when transactions were pending.  
**Solution:** Integrated **loading states, success/error toasts**, and transaction status updates using `react-hot-toast`.

### **3. Gas Fee Optimization**

**Issue:** High gas fees for transactions.  
**Solution:** Optimized contract functions to **minimize gas costs** and used efficient data structures.

---

## **Future Improvements**

- **Support for More Cryptocurrencies:** Expand payment options beyond cUSD.
- **Ticket Reselling & Transfer:** Allow users to resell or transfer event tickets securely via smart contracts.
- **Social Features:** Add attendee profiles and event discussions.
